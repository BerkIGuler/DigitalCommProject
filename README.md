## Q1:
Compare theoretical bit-error rate formula for 16-QAM with experimental results

## Q2
Compare bit error rate approximation (assumes bit errors occur at neighboring constellation points) across different constellation sizes against the theoretical error rate.

## Q3
Plot the PSD of the transmitted random symbols for 16-QAM.
